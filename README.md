<div style="text-align: justify;">

This is an API-client on PHP to integrate Protectimus two-factor authentication into your project easily.

Two-factor authentication from Protectimus is based on one-time passwords (OTP) - passwords that are valid for only one authentication session.
 
To integrate Protectimus into your project, you can use one of these two methods:

<ol>
<li>Integration using the API, directly, or with the help of auxiliary libraries like this one.</li>
<li>Integration using the IFrame Widget for user authentication.</li>
</ol>
 
Independently of the way you have chosen, please, start integration from reading this page: https://www.protectimus.com/for-developers. It contains a lot of important information about how the system works and what you have to do to integrate OTP into your system.

Among other things, our <a href="https://www.protectimus.com/images/pdf/Protectimus_API_Manual_en.pdf">API documentation</a> can be found there. It can help you to understand better what exactly each method does and how to operate with all that stuff.
