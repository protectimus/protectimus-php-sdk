This is an API-client on PHP to easily integrate Protectimus two-factor authentication into your project. 

Two-factor authentication from Protectimus based on one-time passwords (OTP) - passwords that are valid for only one authentication session.

To integrate Protectimus into your project, you can use these two methods:<br/>
1) Integration using the API, directly or with help of auxilary libraries like this one.<br/>
2) Integration using the IFrame Widget for user authentication. 

Independently of the way you have choosed, please start integration from reading this page: https://www.protectimus.com/for-developers. It contains a lot of important information about how the system works and what you have to do to integrate OTP into your system.
